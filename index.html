					<h5>Proposal Objective</h5>
					<p class="proposal"> 
						For this project, as a response to the prompt, I envision creating a navigation system that disappears / reappears when needed (disappears when scrolling through a long page, reappears when just starting to scroll back up), and/or icons/buttons (hybrid) with various hover states to indicate varying levels of importance or relevance to the user and his / her experience (icons when not activated, buttons when hovered over). 					
					</p>
					<p class="proposal">
						By pursuing this proposed project, I hope to learn:
						<ul class="proposal">
							<li>° how to actually create these actions/interactions.</li>
							<li>° improved proficiency in advanced CSS.</li>
							<li>° improved proficiency in JavaScript.</li>
						</ul>
					</p>
					<p class="proposal">
						This proposed project relates to the given prompt in that interactive elements of the page (navigation, buttons) are actually hiding and revealing themselves based on the user’s needs. Furthermore, based on my interpretation of the prompt, this proposed project exemplifies good design by implementing a system that is present when the user needs it, and is subdued or altogether disappeared when the user does not need it.
					</p>
					<p class="proposal">
						In terms of the “grid of affordances,” while this project is a little procedural and very slightly participatory, it is mostly spatial in how it organizes information, creates an experience around the hierarchy, and allows for the most efficient and effective use of screen space.
					</p>
					
					<h5>Existing Knowledge</h5>
					<p class="proposal"> 
						For this proposed project, I am expanding upon my knowledge of technologies/systems/applications that I have previously learned to some degree. I am already proficient in HTML / CSS, have some knowledge of more advanced CSS (media queries, etc), and have some knowledge on writing JavaScript. 					
					</p>
					
					<h5>Required Knowledge</h5>
					<p class="proposal"> 
						In order to execute the proposed project, I will need to learn:
						<ul>
							<li>
								° more advanced CSS: media queries (for determining the screen size and thusly styling the page) and animations (for the overall interactive experience)
							</li>
							<li>
								° mobile-oriented JavaScript (for determining what device a user is using and what states to display)
							</li>
						</ul>
					</p>	
					<p class="proposal"> 	
						Learning this knowledge is feasible within the timeframe of the proposed project. The top-navigation will most likely demand the most amount of time and resources, but this project should be achievable in two weeks.
