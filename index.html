					<h5>Concept</h5>

					<p id="interpretation" class="text">
						To me, the above quote can be interpreted in two ways&#58;
						<ul>
							<li>
								Good design is both present and absent at the same time. Some of the best designs are never noticed because they were intended to not be noticed, but instead contribute to the overall experience.
							</li>
							<li>
								Good user interaction design is comprised of elements that are more subdued when the user doesn&#8217;t need them, but when the user does, they become apparent.
							</li>
						</ul>	
					</p>
					
					<p id="proposal" class="text">
						Prompted by the quote and my interpretation, I have chosen to create a responsive website, with a system of interactive elements that are present when the user needs them, and are subdued or altogether disappeared when the user does not need them. To me, this is very important due to the vast amounts of information and varying screen sizes that exist today.
					</p>
					
					<p id="aboutNavigation" class="text">
						In this site, I have implemented a navigation system that disappears &#47; reappears when needed &#40;disappears when scrolling through a long page, reappears when just starting to scroll back up&#41;. You can see this disappearing &#47; reappearing navigation bar simply by scrolling through this page. It&#8217;s subtle, but it makes all the difference when you are browsing on a mobile device and have limited screen real estate. I have only seen this done with the Google Search bar in Google Now.
					</p>
					
					<p id="aboutIcons" class="text">
						Additionally, I created icon&#47;button hybrids with various hover states to indicate varying levels of importance or relevance to the user and his &#47; her experience. They are icons when not activated and transition to fuller buttons when hovered over so that the user is not interrupted with shiny buttons when they are trying to read through longer pieces of text. The best example of this that I&#8217;ve found is in Google Plus, and I wanted to try my hand at it myself.

					<h5>Icon / Button Hybrids</h5>
					
					<p id="icons" class="text">
						&#123; All of the icons go here! &#125;
					</p>
					
					<p id="note" class="text">
						<span class="underline">Note</span>&#58; since there is no way to hover when using a touch-based device, I have implemented icons that are &#40;flat&#41; icons by default, and &#40;shiny, rounded&#41; buttons when pressed.

						To put all of this in context, here are some existing projects that further demonstrate my interpretation of the quote:
